# Communication

* Exchanges must provide an email address, so IOHK can broadcast issue and update announcements.
* IOHK will create a guest Slack room to support the exchange.

# Requirements

## Nix

The wallet is built using [nix package manager](https://nixos.org/nix/). To install it on
most Linux distros download and run the installation script.

    curl https://nixos.org/nix/install > install-nix.sh
    . install-nix.sh

Follow the directions and then log out and back in.

### Optional: Enable IOHK's binary cache

Skip this section if you prefer to build all code from IOHK
locally. When the binary cache is enabled build steps will tend
go faster.

    sudo mkdir -p /etc/nix
    cat <<EOF | sudo tee /etc/nix/nix.conf
    binary-caches            = https://cache.nixos.org https://hydra.iohk.io
    binary-cache-public-keys = hydra.iohk.io:f/Ea+s+dFdN+3Y/G+FDgSq+a5NEWhJGzdjvKNGv0/EQ=
    EOF

## Miscellaneous Utilities

Use `nix` to install essential utilities.

    nix-env -i git

# Wallet

## Backup local state

Skip to the next section if this is target machine doesn't yet have
`cardano-sl` set up.

To avoid catastrophic data loss, stop the wallet and backup the
local databases, keys, certificates, and logs. By default, the
local state will be in `./state-wallet-mainnet`, but may be
elsewhere (see `stateDir` attribute in `./custom-wallet-config.nix`).

## Fetch latest code

Clone the [cardano-sl repository](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl) or `cd` into a preexisting copy.

    git clone https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl.git
    cd cardano-sl

Switch to the `master` branch and pull the latest code.

    git checkout master
    git pull

Dump the current revision and confirm with IOHK whether it is as
expected.

    git rev-parse HEAD

## Generate custom configuration

The `cardano-sl` repo defaults to using end user topology and settings.

Before building the wallet copy `./sample-wallet-config.nix` to
`./custom-wallet-config.nix` and edit as needed.

Supported options include:

-   **`walletListen`:** Wallet API server
-   **`ekgListen`:** Runtime metrics server
-   **`stateDir`:** Directory for the wallet's local state. Must be
    enclosed in double quotes.
-   **`topologyFile`:** Used to connect to a custom set of nodes on
    the network. When unspecified an appropriate
    default topology is generated.

For exchanges we recommend creating the following `custom-wallet-config.nix`:

    # If any customization is required, copy this file to
    # ./custom-wallet-config.nix and make edits there.
    {
      ## Wallet API server.
      #walletListen = "127.0.0.1:8090";
    
      ## Runtime metrics server.
      #ekgListen = "127.0.0.1:8000";
    
      ## Directory for the wallet's local state. Must be set BEFORE
      ## running nix-build to have any effect, and it must be enclosed in
      ## double quotes.
      stateDir = "./state-wallet-mainnet";
      topologyFile = ./exchange-topology.yaml;
    
      ## See https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/8.0.2/docs/html/users_guide/runtime_control.html#running-a-compiled-program
      #ghcRuntimeArgs = "-N2 -qg -A1m -I0 -T";
    
      ## Primarily used for troubleshooting.
      #additionalNodeArgs = "";
    }


The rest of this document will assume the above configuration file. Please
alter any commands for example related to `stateDir` path to reflect your
setup.

You will also need to add the following `exchange-topology.yaml` file to use the
private relays:

    TODO: private relays should be inserted here in document given to exchanges

## Building and running

We support two different ways to build and run the wallet. You can run
it standalone on any linux system built in the nix store or you can generate
a docker container that can be ran on any docker container orchestrator like
docker swarm or kubernetes.

### Build and run in the nix store

By default the wallet's local state goes in
`./state-wallet-mainnet`.

Build the wallet and generate the shell script to connect to
mainnet (use `connectScripts.stagingWallet` for testnet)

    nix-build -A connectScripts.mainnetWallet -o "./launch_$(date -I)_$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)"

After the build finishes the generated connection script is
available as a symlink called `./launch_2018-01-30_0d4f79eea`, or
similar. Run that symlink as a script to start the wallet.

### Build and run a docker image

Follow the above instructions for customization and dependencies. To build a docker
container and import the image run
(use `connectScripts.stagingWallet` for testnet):

    docker load < $(nix-build -A dockerImages.mainnetWallet)

This will create an image `cardano-container-mainnet:latest`
(or `cardano-container-staging:latest` for testnet)

After this image is built, it can be used like any other docker image being pushed
into a registry and pulled down using your preferred docker orchestration tool.

The image can be ran using the following:

    docker run --name cardano-mainnet-wallet --rm -it -p 127.0.0.1:8090:8090 -p 127.0.0.1:8000:8000 -v state-wallet-mainnet:/wallet cardano-container-mainnet:latest

The above command will create a docker volume named `state-wallet-mainnet` and will mount
that to /wallet. Note: if no volume is mounted to `/wallet` the container startup
script will refuse to execute `cardano-node` and the container will exit.

The location of `/wallet` cannot be changed, but you can mount any kind of volume
you want in that directory that docker supports.

Note that if you give this a different name than is specified above, use the
name you used for any future docker commands in examples in the document.

# Migrating from V0 to V1 API

TODO: add instructions for migrating to new API

# Usage FAQs

## What are recommended hardware/software requirements for exchange wallets?

RAM: 8 GB for building, 4 GB for running

CPU: Modern x86_64 processor

Disk: SSD recommended of 100 GB size with option to allocate more in future
years.

Operating System: NixOS or CentOS 7 recommended, although any linux
distribution should work with nix package manager used for building
the binaries

Software Requirements: Nix package manager for building standalone
and docker containers. On systems using docker, docker > 17.12 required.

## How do I export the CA certificate for the API?

The certificate is generated inside the wallet in the file `tls/server.cert`

If you are using the docker container, this can be output using the command:

`docker exec -it cardano-mainnet-wallet cat /wallet/state-wallet-mainnet/tls/server.cert`

Please refer to your OS or browser documentation for how to import the CA
certificate into your trusted `ca-certificates` file. The rest of this
document will assume the certificate is trusted.

## How do I know when the wallet has fetched all the blocks?

You can check the sync progress using the API to get detailed json output:

    curl -X GET "https://127.0.0.1:8090/api/v1/node-info" -H "accept: application/json;charset=utf-8"
    {"data":{"syncProgress":{"quantity":100,"unit":"percent"},"blockchainHeight":{"quantity":738268,"unit":"blocks"},"localBlockchainHeight":{"quantity":738268,"unit":"blocks"},"localTimeDifference":{"quantity":0,"unit":"microseconds"}},"status":"success","meta":{"pagination":{"totalPages":1,"page":1,"perPage":1,"totalEntries":1}}}

The following command can be used to see the percentage completion of the sync only:

    nix-shell -p jq curl --run 'curl -X GET "https://127.0.0.1:8090/api/v1/node-info" -H "accept: application/json;charset=utf-8" | jq .data.syncProgress.quantity'
    100

## Creating a New Wallet

In the following examples, we will use curl to illustrate request to an API running on the default port 8090.

Please note that wallet web API uses TLS for secure communication. Requests to the API need to send a client CA certificate that was used when launching the node and identifies the client as being permitted to invoke the server API.

Creating a New Wallet
You can create your first wallet using the POST /api/v1/wallets endpoint as follow:

    curl -X POST https://localhost:8090/api/v1/wallets                     \
         -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8"                \
         -H "Accept: application/json; charset=utf-8"                      \
         --cacert ./scripts/tls-files/ca.crt                               \
         -d '{                                                             \
      "operation": "create",                                               \
      "backupPhrase": ["squirrel", "material", "silly", "twice", "direct", \
        "slush", "pistol", "razor", "become", "junk", "kingdom", "flee"],  \
      "assuranceLevel": "normal",                                          \
      "name": "MyFirstWallet"                                              \
    }'
Warning: Those 12 mnemonic words given for the backup phrase act as an example. Do not use them on a production system. See the section below about mnemonic codes for more information.

As a response, the API provides you with a unique wallet id to be used in subsequent requests. Make sure to store it / write it down. Note that every API response is jsend-compliant.

    {
        "status": "success",
        "data": {
            "id": "Ae2tdPwUPE...8V3AVTnqGZ",
            "name": "MyFirstWallet",
            "balance": 0
        },
        "meta": {
            "pagination": {
                "totalPages": 1,
                "page": 1,
                "perPage": 1,
                "totalEntries": 1
            }
        }
    }
You have just created your first wallet. Information about this wallet can be retrieved using the GET /api/v1/wallets/{walletId} endpoint as follows:

    curl -X GET https://localhost:8090/api/v1/wallets/{{walletId}} \
         -H "Accept: application/json; charset=utf-8"              \
         --cacert ./scripts/tls-files/ca.crt

## Receiving Money

To receive Ada from other users you should provide your address. This address can be obtained from an account. Each wallet contains at least one account. An account is like a pocket inside your wallet. View all existing accounts of a wallet by using the GET /api/v1/wallets/{{walletId}}/accounts endpoint:

    curl -X GET https://localhost:8090/api/v1/wallets/{{walletId}}/accounts?page=1&per_page=10 \
         -H "Accept: application/json; charset=utf-8"                                          \
         --cacert ./scripts/tls-files/ca.crt                                                   \
Since you have, for now, only a single wallet, you’ll see something like this:

    {
        "status": "success",
        "data": [
            {
                "index": 2147483648,
                "addresses": [
                    "DdzFFzCqrh...fXSru1pdFE"
                ],
                "amount": 0,
                "name": "Initial account",
                "walletId": "Ae2tdPwUPE...8V3AVTnqGZ"
            }
        ],
        "meta": {
            "pagination": {
                "totalPages": 1,
                "page": 1,
                "perPage": 10,
                "totalEntries": 1
            }
        }
    }
All the wallet’s accounts are listed under the addresses field. You can communicate one of these addresses to receive Ada on the associated account.

## Sending Money

In order to send Ada from one of your accounts to another address, you must create a new payment transaction using the POST /api/v1/transactions endpoint:

    curl -X POST https://localhost:8090/api/v1/transactions \
         -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" \
         -H "Accept: application/json; charset=utf-8"       \
         --cacert ./scripts/tls-files/ca.crt                \
         -d '{                                              \
      "destinations": [{                                    \
        "amount": 14,                                       \
        "address": "A7k5bz1QR2...Tx561NNmfF"                \
      }],                                                   \
      "source": {                                           \
        "accountIndex": 0,                                  \
        "walletId": "Ae2tdPwUPE...8V3AVTnqGZ"               \
      }                                                     \
    }'
Note that, in order to perform a transaction, you need to have enough coins on the source account! The Cardano API is designed to accomodate multiple recipients payments out-of-the-box; notice how destinations is a list of addresses (and corresponding amounts).

When the transaction succeeds, funds are no longer available in the sources addresses, and are soon made available to the destinations. Note that, you can at any time see the status of your wallets by using the GET /api/v1/transactions/{{walletId}} endpoint:

    curl -X GET https://localhost:8090/api/v1/wallets/{{walletId}}?account_index=0  \
         -H "Accept: application/json; charset=utf-8"                               \
         --cacert ./scripts/tls-files/ca.crt                                        \
Here we constrainted the request to a specific account. After our previous transaction the output should look roughly similar to this:

    {
        "status": "success",
        "data": [
            {
                "amount": 14,
                "inputs": [{
                  "amount": 14,
                  "address": "DdzFFzCqrh...fXSru1pdFE"
                }],
                "direction": "outgoing",
                "outputs": [{
                  "amount": 14,
                  "address": "A7k5bz1QR2...Tx561NNmfF"
                }],
                "confirmations": 42,
                "id": "43zkUzCVi7...TT31uDfEF7",
                "type": "local"
            }
        ],
        "meta": {
            "pagination": {
                "totalPages": 1,
                "page": 1,
                "perPage": 10,
                "totalEntries": 1
            }
        }
    }
In addition, and because it is not possible to preview a transaction, one can lookup a transaction’s fees using the POST /api/v1/transactions/fees endpoint to get an estimation of those fees.


## Where can I find the API documentation?

Run the latest wallet and go to <https://127.0.0.1:8090/docs/v1/index>.

For the v0 API documentation (deprecated), go to <https://127.0.0.1:8090/docs/v1/index>.

This URL can be customized with the `walletListen` attribute in `./custom-wallet-configuration.nix`.

## How can I inspect runtime metrics and statistics?

Current metrics and stats are available at <http://127.0.0.1:8000/>.

This URL can be customized with the `ekgListen` attribute in `./custom-wallet-configuration.nix`.
